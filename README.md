# Image Registration
Given two consecutive satellite images, the application implements and uses Harris Corner Algorithm on the images, 
calculates the descriptors of the corners, finds the matching points and implements and uses RANSAC to calulcate
the affine transformation between the two images. Finally it stiches the two images into one.
